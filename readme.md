# AWS CodeSuite and Veracode

How to setup an AWS CodeBuild project with Veracode Static, SCA, and Dynamic Analysis.

## Overview
Veracode integrates with products in the AWS CodeSuite such as CodeBuild and CodePipeline.

For this demonstration we will use the PetStoreAPI written in Python.  

### AWS products weâ€™ll use:

* CodeBuild - this is the primary area we integrate Veracode commands. 
* Cloud9 IDE (very fun and powerful IDE) - we'll use this to run a Docker image for the DAST scan.

### [SAST + SCA Steps ](1_SAST_SCA_PolicyScan)
* Create CodeBuild project
* Enter API keys in environment variables
* Paste in provided buildspec and submit the scan

### [DAST Steps ](2_DAST)
* Use Cloud9 IDE to run the PetstoreAPI Docker Image
* Allow Veracode IP address to access Cloud9 via security group
* Submit the DAST scan

### General Flow [Advanced](Advanced)
* Create S3 bucket for artifact storage
* Create AWS CodeBuild project to submit the scan
* Pull request or component scanning with the SAST Pipeline scanner
* Create OSS Bill of Materials (SCA) for the Docker image itself
* Setup and run a DAST scan
* Using a Veracode Docker image
