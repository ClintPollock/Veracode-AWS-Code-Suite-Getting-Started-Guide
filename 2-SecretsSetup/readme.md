# Veracode API Keys and Docker Secrets Configuration

Next we will setup credentials in the AWS Secrets Manager so we can use Veracode and dockerhub services. We will setup Veracode API and Key and your dockerhub username and password. If you donâ€™t have one, create a free dockerhub account. This is needed so that you can download the docker image into AWS CodeBuild.  It may take several tries to get the CodeBuild projects right. Use the output log to troubleshoot.

You'll also need to have a Veracode account and generate your API Credentials.  Onced logged in to Veracode, click the settings in the top right, and then API Credentials.

## Navigate to AWS Secrets Manager

Now we need to configure the DockerHub username. This allows us to avoid Docker Hub Rate Limiting Errors in CI/CD Pipelines. Customers may not be aware of this.  If you do not have one, create a free Docker account and enter that login detail here.

## Secrets Manager Permissions

NOTE: After each CodeBuild project is created, you must follow this process to give your CodeBuild project access to the Secrets:

## Now we are ready to create a build project using Veracode services.
